# Sunsetter

My second try at this "Ricing" business.

It's very bright and pink. My reasoning is that I'm not really going to be staring at the desktop too often — usually, I'm playing a game or have the browser or editor maximized. This is also why I decided not to add a wallpaper; there is almost always something covering it up, so I just went with a plain solid color.

The colorscheme this time is [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/). Woooow. I used the Frappé palette for most things, but I also stole some colors from the Latte palette as I saw fit.

And yes, the rice is named after the song [Sunsetter](https://youtu.be/WPUR6IN99Ic) from [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/story). But I think that [Moonsetter](https://youtu.be/75kJb_aAvKY) fits the mood I was going for a little better.
